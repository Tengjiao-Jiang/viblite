# VIBLITE

## Introduction

A vision-based line-tracking (VIBLITE) technique has been proposed for uplift measurements of railway catenary systems in front of noisy backgrounds. 

The file contains MATLAB code with example images for processing.

The Line-tracking technique is designed for detecting and tracking a linear object, e.g., a railway catenary wire. The technique is based on a coarse subset and line search and subpixel centerline detection. Vertical displacement response of the linear object can also be obtained.
