# A Vision-Based Line-Tracking Technique (Matlab version with tutorial)

## Introduction

The line-tracking technique is an image-processing technique and is designed for detecting and tracking a linear object, e.g., a railway catenary wire, from noisy backgrounds. The technique is based on a coarse subset and line search and a subpixel centerline detection. The principles are described in detail in the following article [1]. Displacement response of the linear object can be obtained.

The files contain MATLAB code with a tutorial and example images for processing.
